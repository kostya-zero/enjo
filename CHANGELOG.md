# Enjo changelog

## Next

- When Enjo runs template commands, it will now add `ENJO_PROJECT` environment variable with the name of the project. So you can use it in your template commands, e.g. for initializing Go modules with `go mod init $ENJO_PROJECT`.
- When you are running shell session with Enjo, it will add `ENJO_SESSION`, so you can use it in your shell scripts to check if you are running in Enjo session.
- Added `always_accept` option to the configuration of autocomplete. If this option is set to `true`, Enjo will not ask for confirmation when you are trying to open or remove a project, and it will always accept the suggestion.
- The output messages has been rewritten to be more concise.
- When removing a project, the spinner will appear.
- Added autocomplete support for `remove` subcommand.
- Added icons for some CLI messages.
- Added `--pure` flag for `list` and `templates list` to display lists without styles.
- Added `rm` as alias to `remove` command.
- Configuration and templates files are now being lazily loaded, which improves performance and startup time.
- Various internal refactoring and code improvements for better maintainability and error handling.

## 0.7.1

- Added `ls` as alias to `list` command.
- Added `o` as alias to `open` command.
- Command `delete` renamed to `remove`.
- Various internal refactoring and code improvements for better maintainability and error handling.

## 0.7.0

- Templates are now stored in a separate `templates.json` file, created in the same directory as the configuration file. You can add templates manually or manage them using the `templates` command.
- Added `edit` subcommand for `templates` to launch editor with opened `templates.json` file.
- Added support for the `code-insiders` editor.
- The configuration file has a new layout:

  ```toml
  [options]
  projects_directory = '/home/user'
  display_hidden = false

  [editor]
  program = "nvim"
  fork_mode = false
  args = []

  [shell]
  program = "bash"
  args = ["-c"]

  [recent]
  enabled = true
  recent_project = "example"

  [autocomplete]
  enabled = true
  ```

  **Note**: You need to reset your current configuration file; the new version is not compatible with the old format.

- The `shell` section now includes an `args` field. The values in this field will be used when running commands to initialize a project with a template. For example, in PowerShell:

  ```toml
  [shell]
  program = "pwsh.exe"
  args = ["-NoLogo", "-c"]
  # Enjo will execute: powershell.exe -NoLogo -c "{command}"
  ```
